# Molecule Testing

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

## Prerequisites

To utilize Molecule you need to prepare several requirements:

- **x86** computer running one of these operating systems that make use of [systemd](https://systemd.io/):
  - **Archlinux**
  - **CentOS**, **Rocky Linux**, **AlmaLinux**, or possibly other RHEL alternatives (although your mileage may vary)
  - **Debian** (10/Buster or newer)
  - **Ubuntu** (18.04 or newer, although [20.04 may be problematic](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/ansible.md#supported-ansible-versions) if you run the Ansible playbook on it)
- `root` access on the computer which Molecule runs against
- [Ansible](http://ansible.com/) program
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - Most distributions install Python by default, but some don't (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) and require manual installation (something like `apt-get install python3`)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
  - Access to Docker UNIX socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) is required by default

## Installation

To set up the environment for using Molecule, run the command below on the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv ./molecule/venv
source ./molecule/venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./molecule/requirements.txt
```

## Scenarios

Currently there is one testing scenario available.

### `default`

Tests a standard ntfy installation, with access control turned on: the scenario declares one administrator account, which leaves anonymous visitors with the role's default `deny-all` plus its UnifiedPush exception.

Verification walks up from the systemd unit to ntfy actually doing its job:

1. the unit reaches `active`, and `/v1/health` answers
1. the version the running binary reports matches `ntfy_version` in [`defaults/main.yml`](../defaults/main.yml)
1. the configuration the role rendered reaches the running process, read back from the server's own `/config.js`
1. an anonymous publish to a topic no access-control entry covers is refused, while one to a UnifiedPush (`up*`) topic is accepted but cannot be read back anonymously
1. the published message is polled back through the authenticated account, completing a round-trip

An ntfy that never received this role's configuration would still pass the first two steps — the stock image ships no configuration file at all and simply runs on ntfy's own defaults — so the later ones are what distinguish a configured ntfy from a merely running one.

## Running

By default it is configured to run the scenarios on Ubuntu 26.04.

```bash
molecule test --scenario-name default
```

You can utilize other distributions by setting one to the `MOLECULE_DISTRO` environment variable:

```bash
# Ubuntu 24.04
MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu2404 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 13
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian13 molecule test --scenario-name default

# Debian 12
MOLECULE_DISTRO=debian12 molecule test --scenario-name default
```
